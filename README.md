# About

A set of small Python scripts which aim to directly probe and test the [`partition-api`](https://github.com/ISM-Thesis-MultiRobot-Partitioning/partition-api).

Most notably:

- [`post.py`](./post.py) makes a POST request to share data with the API
- [`filepath.py`](./filepath.py) makes a POST request but shares data via a file on the filesystem
